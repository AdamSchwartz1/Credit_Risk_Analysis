# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze credit risk records and use various supervised machine learning techniques to find a model that would best fit this data. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem because there are a lot more good loans over risky loans. I will use a number of resampling methods to try and best fit this data.

Applications used: Python, pandas, imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, jupyter notebook, and github
